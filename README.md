Recommendations and Findings Summary:
1.	Data Non-Uniformity:
•	Identify variations in participant data availability for different variables. Address potential sensor issues or consider self-reporting as a contributing factor. Marketing can emphasize Bell Beat's superior sensor technology and user-friendly self-reporting features through an appealing health dashboard.
2.	Customer Segment: Low Activity Individuals:
•	Implement an alert system for instances with less than 10 steps, promoting it as a safety feature. Generate messages to both users and their contacts. The marketing team can highlight this safety feature to attract safety-conscious users.
3.	Customer Segment: High Sedentary Minutes:
•	Recognize individuals with over 16 hours of sedentary time and suggest simple activities through the app. Market this feature to users concerned about excessive sedentary behavior, emphasizing the app's proactive health recommendations.

•	Identify individuals engaging in heavy activity for over 2 or 3 hours. Introduce a new customer segment for heavy exercisers, and market features or incentives tailored to their workout needs.

•	Recognize abnormal heart rates (below 50 or above 100) and incorporate alerts or guidance within the app. Emphasize this health monitoring feature in marketing campaigns, positioning Bell Beat as a comprehensive health tracker.
7.	Customer Segment: Sleep Management:
•	Address instances of inadequate or excessive sleep, as well as prolonged periods spent in bed without sleep. Integrate sleep management advice within the app and market it as a holistic solution for users seeking better sleep habits.

Future Endeavors for Professional Impact:
In the pursuit of leaving a lasting impression on my boss, I contemplate the following initiatives:
1.	Comprehensive Product Understanding:
•	Thoroughly acquaint myself with the complete range of Bell Beat products, delve into competitor products, understand the target customer demographics, and scrutinize the advertising strategies employed by both Bell Beat and its competitors. Adopt the perspective of customers and the Bell Beat marketing team, revisiting existing challenges for a holistic approach.
2.	Targeted Data Engagement:
•	Engage with data that closely mirrors the characteristics of Bell Beat's target population. This involves aligning with relevant datasets to ensure a more accurate and applicable analysis that resonates with the intended audience.
3.	Qualitative Insights Acquisition:
•	Collaborate with the Marketing team to obtain additional data, particularly focusing on qualitative survey data. In the absence of such data, seek insights from my personal network, gathering feedback and recommendations from individuals within my circle who use tracking devices.
4.	Innovation in Target Population:
•	Investigate the possibility of expanding the target population to include a new demographic. Consider the implementation of an SOS feature within the device, allowing it to send emergency messages to authorities. This potential enhancement not only aligns with user safety but also introduces a novel market segment, showcasing innovation within the product offering.
